The area is rife with outdoor activity no matter the season, but it\u2019s particularly vibrant during the summer months. At nearby Pinecrest Lake, you can fish, hike, swim, and boat during the day, and catch an after-dark flick at the <a href=\"http://gr.pn/10TNHUW\">Pinecrest Amphitheater</a>. With hundreds of miles of dirt trails and four mountain passes, Long Barn is also a popular destination for both on- and off-road motorcycle riding. </p>\n\n<p>There are also two recommended day trips within a two-hour drive of Long Barn. Two hours east is Bodie, one of California\u2019s most famous ghost towns. Once a gold rush-era boomtown with more than 65 saloons, Bodie was deserted in the early 20th century. Today, it\u2019s a <a href=\"http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=509\">State Historic Park</a> that\u2019s open to the public with 100 well-preserved structures. </p>\n\n<p>Less than 90 miles south of Long Barn lies the entrance to <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose\">Yosemite National Park</a>, which welcomes millions of annual visitors. Spring is one of the best times to see the park\u2019s famed <a href=\"http://gr.pn/yIyEnS\">waterfalls</a>, thanks to the snowmelt brought on by warmer weather. Yosemite Falls\u2014a three-tiered waterfall that\u2019s considered North America\u2019s highest\u2014transforms into thundering cataracts each spring. Serious hikers can trek to the top on the strenuous <a href=\"http://gr.pn/sogXkR\">Upper Yosemite Falls</a> trail, which gains 2,700 feet in elevation in just 3.5 miles.</p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-long-barn-lodge#tabs-2\">Read the Fine Print</a> for important info on travel dates and other restrictions.</em></p>","options":[{"expiresInDays":null,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-long-barn-lodge/confirmation?pledge_id=6915339","maximumPurchaseQuantity":2,"discountPercent":44,"status":"open","soldQuantityMessage":"20+","externalUrl":null,"minimumPurchaseQuantity":1,"value":{"currencyCode":"USD","formattedAmount":"$178.00","amount":17800},"initialQuantity":0,"title":"Option 1: Two-night stay in a Two Queen Room","redemptionLocations":[{"streetAddress2":"","neighborhood":"Greater Yosemite","postalCode":"95335","country":"US","phoneNumber":"","lat":38.091624,"name":"","state":"California","id":6567407,"streetAddress1":"25957 Long Barn Road","city":"Long Barn","lng":-120.136067}],"bookable":false,"specificAttributes":{},"details":[{"description":"Must book by 6/14/13 or promotional value expires.\u00a0Must complete travel by 7/31/13.

Located on an island within Turneffe Atoll, Blackbird Caye Resort overlooks a 2-mile-long private beach nestled among coconut trees and 1,300 acres of jungle. If you walk down the beach\u2019s two whitewashed docks that extend into the Caribbean, you might spot bonefish, barracuda, stingrays, and nurse sharks.</p>\n\n<p>With ocean temperatures hovering around 82 degrees, scuba diving and snorkeling are Turneffe Atoll's main attractions. More than 70 diving and snorkeling sites are within a 15-minute boat ride of Blackbird. Explore shallow reefs on <a href=\"http://www.blackbirdresort.com/activities/snorkeling.html\">snorkeling trips</a>, which take you among coral, sea fans, and brightly colored fish. Use the resort\u2019s complimentary sea kayaks to navigate mangrove-laden lagoons and spot dolphins. The resort offers three daily dives, two daily snorkeling trips and kayak expeditions, and one weekly diving trip to Belize\u2019s famous Great Blue Hole.</p>\n\n<p>After a day spent exploring the sea, retire to your private beachfront cabana covered with a thatched roof. Standard, superior, and deluxe <a href=\"http://www.blackbirdresort.com/accommodations-2.html\">cabanas</a> come with air conditioning and private porches with hammocks. Each day, the resort\u2019s palapa-style restaurant at the main dock serves three meals of fresh island cuisine. Dinner is a sit-down affair with your choice of meat, chicken, or fish, plus a housemade dessert.</p>\n\n<h4>Turneffe Atoll, Belize: World-Class Scuba Diving and Snorkeling</h4>\n\n<p>Located about 25 miles off the coast of Belize City, Blackbird Caye Resort is only a short boat ride from the <a href=\"http://gr.pn/AbUPqD\">Great Blue Hole</a>, one of Belize's most iconic natural landmarks. Located near the middle of Lighthouse Reef, the Great Blue Hole is a 400-foot-deep limestone sinkhole that forms a nearly perfect circle in a brilliant shade of navy blue. As divers descend into the hole, they see limestone stalactites and stalagmites hanging off the walls.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://gr.pn/zpjgrP\">Half Moon Caye Natural Monument</a> in the southeast corner of Lighthouse Reef is home to some of Belize's most exotic land animals as well as a diverse assortment of underwater creatures. Rare red-footed boobies nest on the cay for about 10 months out of the year, then spend the other 2 months playing shuffleboard in Naples.</p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-blackbird-caye-resort-4#tabs-2\">Read the Fine Print</a> for important info on travel dates and other restrictions.</em></p>","options":[{"expiresInDays":null,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-blackbird-caye-resort-4/confirmation?pledge_id=6824178","maximumPurchaseQuantity":4,"discountPercent":49,"status":"open","soldQuantityMessage":"20+","externalUrl":null,"minimumPurchaseQuantity":1,"value":{"currencyCode":"USD","formattedAmount":"$1,770.00","amount":177000},"initialQuantity":0,"title":"Option 1: Four nights in a standard cabana","redemptionLocations":[{"streetAddress2":"","neighborhood":"Turneffe Atoll, Belize","postalCode":"-","country":"Belize","phoneNumber":"","lat":17.46267,"name":"","state":"","id":6486129,"streetAddress1":"Turneffe Atoll","city":"Turneffe Atoll","lng":-88.061602}],"bookable":false,"specificAttributes":{},"details":[{"description":"Book by 6/7/13 or promo value expires.

The founders of Akribos XXIV were fascinated by the ancient history of timekeeping, which has roots in Greece and Rome. To commemorate the ancient art, they named their company for the two powers. In Greek, <em>Akribos</em> means \u201cexact and precise;\u201d XXIV are the Roman numerals for 24, as well as Prince\u2019s latest signature. Taken together, the name both pays homage to the past and makes a promise for the future. Each timepiece the company crafts is meticulously designed to track all 24 hours in a day. Furthermore, every watch doubles as an eye-catching accessory. Details such as sunray dials, crystal-accented bezels, and braided bracelets represent the company\u2019s distinctive style: bold, fashion-forward, and functional.</p>\n\n<h5>Features</h5>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Watches for men and women</li>\n<li>Analog display</li>\n<li>White ceramic cases </li>\n<li>Some styles feature mother-of-pearl dials or crystal accents</li>\n<li>Japanese or Swiss quartz movement</li>\n<li>Water resistant like a coconut in a swim cap\n<p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><p><hr></p>\n\n<p><i>How to get your goods: by purchasing this Groupon and providing your name and shipping address, your order is complete!\n<br><br>\nFor questions pertaining to this deal, please visit the deal Q&amp;A on this page.
