From choreographer Helen Pickett, who studied as a dancer under Michael Smuin at the San Francisco Ballet School, comes the West Coast premiere of  Petal,  an effervescent piece set to music by Philip Glass and Thomas Montgomery Newman, that was called \"the perfect piece for spring\" by  Atlanta Magazine . Darrell Grand Moultrie gives Bay Area audiences their first look at his  JAZZIN' , a sultry ballet set to jazz music by Wynton Marsalis, Duke Ellington, Billy Strayhorn and Andy Razaf. Finally, Michael Smuin's romantic and lovely  Chants d'Auvergne  is a series of solos, duets, trios and ensemble pieces set to traditional French songs arranged by Joseph Cantaloube.","expirationDate":"2013-04-21","postDate":"2013-04-16 04:12:21","showImage":"https:\/\/i.goldstar.com\/gse_media\/113\/2\/spring-0327132.jpg","showLogo":"http:\/\/www.8coupons.com\/partners\/logo\/small\/goldstar.png","up":null,"down":null,"DealTypeID":null,"categoryID":"2","subcategoryID":"57","lat":"37.3895","lon":"-122.082","distance":"4.98320444605789","dealOriginalPrice":"52","dealPrice":"28","dealSavings":"25","dealDiscountPercent":"47"},{"affiliate":"yes","name":"A Youthful Reflection","address":"330 S.
