# Around The Corner

Senior project for CS 210.

Synopsis:
"Our team is working on a product we like to call 'Around the Corner.' It is a mobile application for Android OS that will allow businesses to foster a unique kind of relationship with potential customers nearby. Using a phone’s GPS capabilities, the app observes what locations the app user tends to frequent most often and highlights such locations as special (we call it 'pinning' a location). The app can then serve deals and special offers to the user based on these pinned locations (as well as the user’s current location). The deals help the user, and local businesses also benefit by attracting customers who are more likely to return simply because these app users pass by so often. A win-win situation."
