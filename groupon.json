Martinez and the lower-registered Nick Hexum. 311\u2019s \u201890s success hasn\u2019t slowed in the 21st century as the band continues to tour like the Grateful Dead on skateboards while expanding their palette on their most recent albums <i>Uplifter</i> and <i>Universal Pulse</i>.

The burly foursome, consisting of MCs B-Real and Sen Dog, percussionist Eric Bobo, and mixmaster DJ Muggs, were incomparable in those <i>Alternative Nation</i> days, having tapped into a brand-new sound as others relied on the fading sound of grunge. Atop funky drum-and-bass loops, spooky and experimental samples that screech like a dolphin slamming on the brakes, and infectiously congested vocals, Cypress Hill first exploded on the scene with hits such as \u201cHow I Could Just Kill a Man,\u201d \u201cHand on the Pump,\u201d and the bilingual \u201cLatin Lingo.\u201d From there, the group went from incomparable to inescapable with the massive earworm \u201cInsane in the Brain,\u201d made instantly recognizable by B-Real\u2019s high-pitched nasal voice. Although champions of the mellow lifestyle, the group still brings bounding energy to their summer tour. The quartet prowls the stage amid seas of flailing arms as they perform greatest hits and tracks from their latest collaborative EP, <i>Cypress x Rusko</i>, which adds dubstep into their dank musical formula.<p>\n<strong>Cypress Hill \u2013 \u201cHits From the Bong\u201d (Live at \u201cThe Smokeout\u201d 2012)</strong> <br>\n<i>Warning: Contains profanity, tobacco paraphernalia, and Cypress Hill acting like Cypress Hill.</i> </p>\n\n<iframe width=\"450\" height=\"243\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/xyqVVfj5qE8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p><p></p>\n\n<h4>G. Love &amp; Special Sauce</h4>\n\n<p>G. Love &amp; Special Sauce\nWhen critics and fans refer to G. Love &amp; Special Sauce as \u201csloppy,\u201d it\u2019s meant as a compliment. With their musical gumbo of Mississippi blues slow cooked in a stock of hip-hop, the band broke out in 1994 with slinky jams such as \u201cCold Beverage\u201d and \u201cBaby\u2019s Got Sauce.\u201d Since then, the group has continued to pack even more soulful, bluesy, and funky sounds into their stuffed suitcase of influences, crafting a style that suggests Dr. John giving birth to the Beastie Boys as Robert Johnson plays midwife.

While you\u2019re in each city, you\u2019ll have free rein to visit whatever you like\u2014from taking in a panoramic view of the City of Light from the hilltop at Montmartre to walking up the Spanish Steps and sampling gelato in Rome. In both cities, you\u2019ll get two-day tickets for a hop-on, hop-off multi-lingual sightseeing tour.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Day 1: In flight</strong>\nFlight times vary, but flights to Paris typically take 12 hours from Los Angeles, and 8 hours from New York and Washington D.C.</p>\n\n<h4>Days 2-4: Paris</h4>\n\n<p>Paris enchants visitors with its storied landmarks\u2014the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame Cathedral, and the Louvre. But try to save time for the <a href=\"http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/\">Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay</a>, located inside a turn-of-the-century railway station on the Left Bank of the Seine. Here, you\u2019ll see one of the world\u2019s largest collections of impressionist paintings, including work by Monet, Manet, and van Gogh, as well as <em>Whistler\u2019s Mother</em>. Other stops on the two-hour sightseeing tour include the majestic Arc de Triomphe, the expansive Champ de Mars, and the Trocad\u00e9ro. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Accommodations:</strong> Stay overnight at the 4-star <a href=\"http://gr.pn/YSRAug\">Villa Eugenie</a> (or a similar hotel, depending on availability).

Its location puts you close to Montmartre, the famous bohemian neighborhood that attracted artists like Picasso, Van Gogh, and Dali. Montmarte is also known for its late 19th-century cabarets, most notably Moulin Rouge and Le Chat Noir. </p>\n\n<h4>Days 5-7: Rome</h4>\n\n<p>After a morning flight to Rome, you\u2019ll have plenty of time to see the Eternal City\u2014a title that encapsulates Rome\u2019s ancient history and present-day charm. The city\u2019s most-ironic attraction is the Colosseum, a massive Roman amphitheater located in the city\u2019s center. But there\u2019s plenty else to see as well\u2014just follow the city\u2019s cobblestone paths, which lead past fashionable boutiques and intimate cafes. Or use your two-day sightseeing ticket, which includes stops at the 17th-century Trevi Fountain and Piazza Venezia, Rome\u2019s main hub.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Accommodations:</strong> Stay at the 4-star <a href=\"http://gr.pn/ZzVqog\">Worldhotel Ripa Roma</a> (or a similar hotel, depending on availability). The Worldhotel Ripa Roma puts you in the heart of the historical neighborhood of Trastevere. Its labyrinth-like walkways and clothes strung between buildings give it the feel of Old-World Italy. It\u2019s also especially charming at night, ideal for a romantic stroll or a late dinner. <strong>Note:</strong> Trips in November will have accommodations at the 4-star <a href=\"http://www.hotelh10romacitta.com/en/index.html\">H10 Roma Citta</a>. </p>\n\n<p>On the morning of Day 8, you\u2019ll head to the Rome airport and board your flight home. </p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-go-today#tabs-2\">Read the Fine Print</a> for important info on travel dates and other restrictions.</em></p>","options":[{"expiresInDays":null,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-go-today/confirmation?pledge_id=6843683","maximumPurchaseQuantity":25,"discountPercent":42,"status":"open","soldQuantityMessage":"10+","externalUrl":null,"minimumPurchaseQuantity":1,"value":{"formattedAmount":"$2,922.00","amount":292200,"currencyCode":"USD"},"initialQuantity":0,"bookable":false,"title":"Option 1: Depart 11/18/13 from New York","redemptionLocations":[{"neighborhood":"","country":"Italy","postalCode":"00153","lng":12.470633,"phoneNumber":"","city":"Rome","lat":41.88245,"name":"Worldhotel Ripa Roma","streetAddress1":"Via Orti di Trastevere 3","state":"","id":6502623,"streetAddress2":""},{"neighborhood":"Paris and Rome","country":"France","postalCode":"75017","lng":2.314207,"phoneNumber":"","city":"Paris","lat":48.887203,"name":"","streetAddress1":"Villa Eugenie","state":"Ile-de-France","id":6502625,"streetAddress2":"167 rue de Rome | 17th Arr."}],"discount":{"formattedAmount":"$1,223.00","amount":122300,"currencyCode":"USD"},"specificAttributes":{},"price":{"formattedAmount":"$1,699.00","amount":169900,"currencyCode":"USD"},"details":[{"description":"For options departing 5/22 or 6/11; book by 4/24/13 or promotional value expires.

Located on an island within Turneffe Atoll, Blackbird Caye Resort overlooks a 2-mile-long private beach nestled among coconut trees and 1,300 acres of jungle. If you walk down the beach\u2019s two whitewashed docks that extend into the Caribbean, you might spot bonefish, barracuda, stingrays, and nurse sharks.</p>\n\n<p>With ocean temperatures hovering around 82 degrees, scuba diving and snorkeling are Turneffe Atoll's main attractions. More than 70 diving and snorkeling sites are within a 15-minute boat ride of Blackbird. Explore shallow reefs on <a href=\"http://www.blackbirdresort.com/activities/snorkeling.html\">snorkeling trips</a>, which take you among coral, sea fans, and brightly colored fish. Use the resort\u2019s complimentary sea kayaks to navigate mangrove-laden lagoons and spot dolphins. The resort offers three daily dives, two daily snorkeling trips and kayak expeditions, and one weekly diving trip to Belize\u2019s famous Great Blue Hole.</p>\n\n<p>After a day spent exploring the sea, retire to your private beachfront cabana covered with a thatched roof. Standard, superior, and deluxe <a href=\"http://www.blackbirdresort.com/accommodations-2.html\">cabanas</a> come with air conditioning and private porches with hammocks. Each day, the resort\u2019s palapa-style restaurant at the main dock serves three meals of fresh island cuisine. Dinner is a sit-down affair with your choice of meat, chicken, or fish, plus a housemade dessert.</p>\n\n<h4>Turneffe Atoll, Belize: World-Class Scuba Diving and Snorkeling</h4>\n\n<p>Located about 25 miles off the coast of Belize City, Blackbird Caye Resort is only a short boat ride from the <a href=\"http://gr.pn/AbUPqD\">Great Blue Hole</a>, one of Belize's most iconic natural landmarks. Located near the middle of Lighthouse Reef, the Great Blue Hole is a 400-foot-deep limestone sinkhole that forms a nearly perfect circle in a brilliant shade of navy blue. As divers descend into the hole, they see limestone stalactites and stalagmites hanging off the walls.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://gr.pn/zpjgrP\">Half Moon Caye Natural Monument</a> in the southeast corner of Lighthouse Reef is home to some of Belize's most exotic land animals as well as a diverse assortment of underwater creatures. Rare red-footed boobies nest on the cay for about 10 months out of the year, then spend the other 2 months playing shuffleboard in Naples.</p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-blackbird-caye-resort-4#tabs-2\">Read the Fine Print</a> for important info on travel dates and other restrictions.</em></p>","options":[{"expiresInDays":null,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-blackbird-caye-resort-4/confirmation?pledge_id=6824178","maximumPurchaseQuantity":4,"discountPercent":49,"status":"open","soldQuantityMessage":"10+","externalUrl":null,"minimumPurchaseQuantity":1,"value":{"formattedAmount":"$1,770.00","amount":177000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"initialQuantity":0,"bookable":false,"title":"Option 1: Four nights in a standard cabana","redemptionLocations":[{"neighborhood":"Turneffe Atoll, Belize","country":"Belize","postalCode":"-","lng":-88.061602,"phoneNumber":"","city":"Turneffe Atoll","lat":17.46267,"name":"","streetAddress1":"Turneffe Atoll","state":"","id":6486129,"streetAddress2":""}],"discount":{"formattedAmount":"$871.00","amount":87100,"currencyCode":"USD"},"specificAttributes":{},"price":{"formattedAmount":"$899.00","amount":89900,"currencyCode":"USD"},"details":[{"description":"Book by 6/7/13 or promo value expires.

As the lymph releases harmful substances absorbed through air, food, and shirts made of mercury, the vinegar pulls these impurities out through the skin.
